# Advent-Of-Code

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This is a repo containing my solutions to Eric Wastl's Advent of Code. All of the solutions are written in JavaScript.
